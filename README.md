# Frequent-Itemsets
This project developed in order to experiment with famous algorithms for finding frequent itemsets.  
  
  
In this project we use and check the results in varius algorithms such as Apriori, Exact Counting and SON.  
The goal is to find frequent itemsets and create communities from them. We use a movielens database with users  
and movies.
