# Frequent-Itemsets
This project developed in order to experiment with famous algorithms for finding frequent itemsets.  
  
  
This project was developed for the "Algorithms for Big Data" course at the
department of Computer Science and Engineering in University Of Ioannina.
  
  
In this project we use and check the results in varius algorithms such as Apriori, Exact Counting and SON.  
The goal is to find frequent itemsets and create communities from them. We use a movielens database with users  
and movies.
